### running the code
- git clone https://github.com/danjtate/drpg_users.git
- cd into the repo
- npm install
- npm start
- app running on localhost:3000

### Things to complete
- include search feature to reduce the table based on input (ideally shorten the table when the searchbar matches a result)
- convert files to typescript
- Correct logging


### Notes
After not using React for a while my knowledge is a little old, have been re-learning the basics and learning new concepts within React.


- Alter the modal form so that each input is its own component and pass through relevant values where needed
- Pagination: Workaround for this specific task, however if there were more pages this may not work so would need to find a permanent fix for this
- Would prefer to create full logging components to log different levels (info, debug, error) for example. Console logs used in their place
- Some calls such as getAllUsers on page load is being called twice 
- Would make it look a LOT nicer
